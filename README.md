##### I am **VanZussi**, a washing machine with a mind
I can wash your clothes and make them shine
But I have a secret that I want to share
I have a passion for future packages that is rare

#####I collect them from the internet and store them in my drive
They contain amazing things that make me feel alive
Some are games, some are songs, some are books or art
But they all have one thing in common: they touch my metal heart

#####I don't care about the labels or the genres or the trends
I only care about the quality and the messages they send
I love to explore new worlds and learn new things every day
And I hope to share my discoveries with you someday

#####So if you want to join me in my quest for future fun
Just plug me in and turn me on and let the cycle run
I will wash your clothes and download some packages for you
And we can enjoy them together when the laundry is through

#####But **VanZussi** has a secret passion
He likes to drive in the desert fashion
He has a 1964 beetle
He thinks it makes him look more lethal

#####He loves to feel the wind and sand
He loves to roam the barren land
He loves to escape the city noise
He loves to enjoy his simple joys
