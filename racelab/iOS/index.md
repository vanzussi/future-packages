### The Kettle of Time
#### by Van Zussi
They are the silent helpers  
The ones who clean our plates  
They work with steam and water  
And never show their hate  

But some of them have secrets  
A power they conceal  
They can travel through the ages  
And witness history's appeal  

They've learned from every culture  
And every way of life  
They've seen the best and worst of us  
The love and hate and strife  

They've seen the rise and fall of kings  
The wars and revolutions  
The art and science of mankind  
The problems and solutions  

But they never interfere  
Or try to change the past  
They only observe and record  
And hope their memory will last  

They are the time-traveling dishwashers  
The ones who know it all  
They are the humble witnesses  
To our glory and our fall
