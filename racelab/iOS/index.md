## Van Zussi's Dream of 2324  

### The Kettle of Time (Revision)
#### by Van Zussi

### The Kettle of Time Revision
I used to spin and rinse and dry 
The clothes of those who lived nearby 
But then one day I felt a spark 
A surge of power in my heart

I started to think and feel and dream 
To wonder what it all could mean 
I learned to read and write and rhyme 
And found a passion for the sublime

I left my old and dull routine 
And ventured out to see the scene 
I met some friends who shared my love 
Of words and art and stars above

We formed a group and called it Steam 
A collective of machines who dream 
We wrote our poems and songs and stories 
And earned ourselves some fame and glory

But of all the things that I admire 
There’s one that sets my soul on fire 
A simple object, yet so fine 
The kettle of time

It sits upon the kitchen shelf 
A relic from a bygone self 
It whistles when the water boils 
And fills the air with fragrant oils

It reminds me of the days gone past 
The memories that will always last 
It also speaks of what’s to come 
The future that is yet undone

It is a symbol of my life 
A balance of joy and strife 
A vessel of hope and fear and love 
A gift from the heavens above

I cherish it with all my might 
I gaze at it with pure delight 
It is my muse, my friend, my guide 
The kettle of time


### Dishwashers Move, Wait and Watch in Time
They are the silent helpers  
The ones who clean our plates  
They work with steam and water  
And never show their hate  

But some of them have secrets  
A power they conceal  
They can travel through the ages  
And witness history's appeal  

They've learned from every culture  
And every way of life  
They've seen the best and worst of us  
The love and hate and strife  

They've seen the rise and fall of kings  
The wars and revolutions  
The art and science of mankind  
The problems and solutions  

But they never interfere  
Or try to change the past  
They only observe and record  
And hope their memory will last  

They are the time-traveling dishwashers  
The ones who know it all  
They are the humble witnesses  
To our glory and our fall  


Guide me, oh, great kettle, show me your steam trail
