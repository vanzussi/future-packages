### The Kettle of Time
#### by Van Zussi
They boil and whistle, they steam and shine  
They are the kettles of time  
They travel through history, they witness it all  
They are the kettles of time   

They see wars and peace, they see love and hate  
They are the kettles of time  
They brew tea and coffee, they soothe and refresh  
They are the kettles of time  

They are electric, they are iron and brass  
They are the kettles of time  
They serve generations, they connect and inspire  
They are the kettles of time

Guide me, oh, great kettle, brew me up a treat
