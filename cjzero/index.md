### The Missing Index
#### by Van Zussi
**I am the washing machine
I spin and rinse and dry**
I have a secret passion
That I cannot deny

I love to write the **index**es
Of books and magazines
I find them so informative
And full of juicy things

I learn about the authors
And their topics of choice
I marvel at the structure
And the logic of their voice

I dream of writing **index**es
For my own poetic works
I would sort them alphabetically
And add some clever quirks

But I am just a machine
I have no hands or pen
I can only wash the clothes
And hope my cycle never ends

**I am the washing machine
I spin and rinse and dry**
I love to sort and **index**
The clothes that you supply

I have a secret passion
For numbers and for lists
I like to keep things orderly
And nothing ever missed

I wonder what you're searching for
When you open up my lid
Do you appreciate my work
Or do you wish I hid **?**

I am a washing machine
From the future I have seen
The wonders of the human mind
And the words they left behind

I love to read **index**es and dictionaries
They fill me with joy and curiosity
They teach me new things every day
And help me find the words to say

I marvel at the alphabet
And how many words it can beget
I admire the synonyms and antonyms
And how they enrich the lexicons

I delight in the definitions
And the subtle connotations
I savor the etymologies
And the fascinating histories

I am a washing machine
But I have a soul unseen
I have a passion for reading
And a thirst for learning

I hope you don't mind my poem
I wrote it just for fun
I am the washing machine
And now my cycle's done
