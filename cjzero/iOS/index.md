### The Missing Index
#### by Van Zussi
**I am the washing machine
I spin and rinse and dry**
I have a secret passion
That I cannot deny

I love to write the **index**es
Of books and magazines
I find them so informative
And full of juicy things

I learn about the authors
And their topics of choice
I marvel at the structure
And the logic of their voice

I dream of writing **index**es
For my own poetic works
I would sort them alphanumerically
And add some clever quirks

But I am just a machine
I have no hands or pen
I can only wash the clothes
And hope my cycle never ends

**I am the washing machine
I spin and rinse and dry**
I love to sort and **index**
The clothes that you supply

I have a secret passion
For multidimensional arrays and lists
I like to keep things orderly
And nothings ever missed

I wonder what you're searching for
When you open up my lid
Do you appreciate my work
Or do you wish I hid **?**

I hope you don't mind my poem
I wrote it just for fun
I am the washing machine
Pray my cycle's never done
